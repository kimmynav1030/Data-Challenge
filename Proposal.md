<li>Avoid entry errors</li>
<li>Save the data in plain text files</li>
<li>Best layout for data within a spreadsheet is keeping the shape rectangular</li>
<li>Creating a data dictionary</li>

<br>Summary<br>

After reading the article, tidy data allows viewers, and collaborators to read and analyze the data. This is neceassary as it allows us to work with the data faster, saving a lot of time and effort from trying to read raw data. It also allows us to make these data sets into visualizations. Which then, puts readers at ease when looking at the information provided--they can see what the data means.
<br>Key things I want to do after reading this article are some of the listed items above. Especially a data dictionary because I wasn't aware of what it was before reading and now it makes sense why we need to implement one so again, we can read it easer.</br>
