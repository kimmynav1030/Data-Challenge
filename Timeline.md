</ul>
● Week 1 Design:
○ Finding information and resources available to utilize for our research.
○
● Week 2 Prototype:
○ Officially creating a repository on GitHub
○ Analyzing our gathered data by filtering through what variables we want to focus
on.
○ Using these variables to create a table for our computed values such as averages,
consensus, etc.
○ Utilizing the values from our table, we can create GGplot visualizations as well
as using Tableau, for example.
● Week 3 Build:
○ Processing and finalizing our data and dashboards, making sure everything is well organized and aesthetically pleasing.
○ Summarizing our findings by grouping data sets, omitting anything unnecessary
4
○ Adding textual information to our proposal for background information, context, and relevance–why it’s important.
● Week 4 Deploy:
○ Using feedback given by the professor as well as our peers, we will make
keynotes on what we need to improve or change.
○ Utilizing our notes, we can make changes to our designs and finalize our
proposal.
○ Testing our User Interface to make sure any changes need to be made; ensure it is
running smoothly.
○ Finally, we will deploy our website containing the work we have done on this
proposal.
