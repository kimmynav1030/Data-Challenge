Timeline
<ul>Week 1 Design
<li>Finding information and resources available to utilize for our research.</li>
<li>Importing the data sources that are necessary and important for our topic.</li>
<li>Drafting ideas for how our dashboard will be presented and what key ideas we
want to use.</li>
<li>Stating our objectives of what we want to accomplish with our findings.</li>
<li>Potentially start a proposal repository on GitHub</li>
</ul>

<ul>Week 2 Prototype:
 <li>Officially creating a repository on GitHub</li>
 <li>Analyzing our gathered data by filtering through what variables we want to focus
on.</li>
 <li>Using these variables to create a table for our computed values such as averages,
consensus, etc.</li>
 <li>Utilizing the values from our table, we can create GGplot visualizations as well
as using Tableau, for example.</li><</ul>

<ul>Week 3 Build:
<li>Processing and finalizing our data and dashboards, making sure everything is well organized and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
<li>Summarizing our findings by grouping data sets, omitting anything unnecessary</li>
<li>Adding textual information to our proposal for background information, context, and relevance–why it’s important.</li></ul>

<ul>Week 4 Deploy:
<li>Using feedback given by the professor as well as our peers, we will make
keynotes on what we need to improve or change.</li>
<li>Utilizing our notes, we can make changes to our designs and finalize our
proposal.</li>
<li>Testing our User Interface to make sure any changes need to be made; ensure it is
running smoothly.</li>
<li>Finally, we will deploy our website containing the work we have done on this
proposal.</li>
